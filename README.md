# Project Title

Car Dealership Console Application

## Description of the Project

Car dealership console application is designed for dealerships to filter cars through various different searches, list,
add and remove vehicles. It reads from a file and overwrites the csv file with new vehicle information.
## User Stories

- As a user, I want to be able to make a purchase so that I can get a contract of the car I want to sell.
- As a user, I want to lease cars so that I can choose to lease cars based on my preference.
- As a user, I want to only look at available cars so that I don't waste my time looking up vehicle that aren't in the inventory.
- As a user, I want to be able to make a purchase without calculating the price so that I don't have to waste my time.
